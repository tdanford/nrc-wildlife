Some Java utilities for dealing with wildlife data out of some of Rachel's projects.  Right now, there are two different utilities here: 
* cavitynesting : presents a tree-based viewer for the sqlite3 database files produced by the 'cavitynesting' project. 
* forestcover : utilities for calculating forest-cover, by allowing the user to annotate stitched-together (ortho-normal) satellite photographs presented as PNGs, with polygons.
